# ModuleBrowser
A extremely simple easy-to-use Roblox module GUI; feel free to give this a star if you want! For ROBLOX staff and anticheat developers; this is not ment to be malicious in any way. This script is to preserve Roblox ModuleScripts.

NOTE: This project is no longer in development due to my desktop being unusable due to a virus crashing my PC multiple times every few hours to seconds, so here I am using my laptop. (update; I've gotten Windows uninstalled and switched to Ubuntu, soon I'll re-continue this project)

Want the RBXM? Go to `github.com/LuaGunsX/ModuleBrowser/releases` for a list of releases.

The module is here: require(15500675064).MB("username")
